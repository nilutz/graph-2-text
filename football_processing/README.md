# Preprocessing for football data

needs a sentences_full_*.pkl file in a data/football folder. This file is generated by [data-extractor]
Then run:
	
	python preprocess.py -c -f -p ../data/data-football/sentences_full_notdelex.pkl

	python preprocess.py -c -f -p ../data/data-football/sentences_full_delex.pkl

those create folders in data/data-football folders for each type.
