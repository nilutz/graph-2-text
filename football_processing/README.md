# Preprocessing for football data

needs a sentences_full_*.pkl file in a data/football folder. This file is generated by [data-extractor]
Then run:
	
	python preprocess.py -c -f -p ../data/data-football/sentences_full_notdelex.pkl

	python preprocess.py -c -f -p ../data/data-football/sentences_full_delex.pkl

those create folders in data/data-football folders for each type.


# Training

follow the commands


# Postprocessing
if you've trained with *delex* you need to relex the Entity Desriptions to effectivly compare to the reference

	python relex.py 

creates relexicalised_predictions_test.txt

to compare go into folder

	cd data/data-football/delex_

	../../../football_processing/calculate_bleu.sh

and there you have the BLEU score.
