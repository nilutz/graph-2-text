# Preprocessing for football data

needs a data_with_tripels_full.pkl file in a data/football folder. This file is generated by [data-extractor]
Then run:
	
	python preprocess.py -o sentence -c -f

	python preprocess.py -o delex -c -f

	python preprocess.py -o delex_lower -c -f

	python preprocess.py -o lower -c -f

those create folders in data/football folders for each type.
